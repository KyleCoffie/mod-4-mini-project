Welcome to my library management database.
The main menu consist of three options.
1.
Book Operations where you can add a book,borrow a book, return a book,search for a book, and display all books.
For the borrow book function the book table will update the availability to 0 and the book will show in the borrowed books table.
Once the book is returned the book will be deleted from the borrowed books table and then will show the availability of one in the books table.
2.
User operations will let you add a user, display user details, display all users and delete a user from the system.
A library_id will be auto-generated for each user created.
3.
Author operartion will allow you to add author,view a specific authors details, view all authors and delete an author.
